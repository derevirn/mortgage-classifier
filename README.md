# Mortgage approval binary classifier
A binary classifier that predicts whether a mortgage application will be approved or not, based on XGBoost. I started this project to participate in the data science competition of the (now defunct) Microsoft Professional Program. My model managed to rank in the 90th percentile of all entries. The Jupyter notebooks include exploratory data analysis, a deep learning Keras model, as well as the XGBoost model. A report is also available in PDF format.
